# Course-Registration-System-

This program stores information about university courses, and allows both admins and students to manage courses. 

How it works: 
Run MainPorgram to run the Course Registration Program. 
At the beginning of lunching the program, it will read "MyUniversityCourses.csv" to obtain all course information. All changes made to program by user will be saved and serialised.
